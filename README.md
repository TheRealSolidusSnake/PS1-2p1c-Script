# PS1-2p1c-Script

Simple script to allow 2 (or more if wanted) players to swap controls to play 1 player games with more people

Same concept as Link to the Past 2 player 1 controller or other such concepts, controls swap so you both have to be doing nearly the same inputs or chaos ensues.

Only tested personally on Final Fantasy 9 NTSC, and was written with BizHawk (NymaShock core) in mind, feel free to leave an ***Issue*** if a game doesn't work and I can try to take a look into it.
